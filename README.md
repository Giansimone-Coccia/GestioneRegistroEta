# GestioneRegistroEta
this project in Java, allows the Guest to control the people's registry
based on their years, absorbed by an external file. In this way is possible to 
increase a person's year by the researching via his/her name and, also print all the 
registry on a different file. Giansimone Coccia and Walter Di Sabatino.
